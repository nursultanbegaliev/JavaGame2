## What I changed
1. Initially game was slow. So I changed movement method. I increased speed of the ball and decreased delay. 
2. Game was finishing quickly, that's why I increased number of bricks and made them smaller size.
Was 21 brick 3 row 7 column, become 32 brincks 4 row 8 column
3. Changed colors of course
4. Added how many score got palyer near "Game Over"
